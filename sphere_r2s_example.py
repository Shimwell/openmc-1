# makes a sphere of Silver and irradiates it with a 14MeV neutron source.
# The activated material emits gammas and these are transported and tallied
# on a mesh tally. The resulting decay gamma flux is plotted as a series of
# images so that the variation over time can be observed. Note that silver
# activation results in Ag110 which has a half life of 24 seconds. The
# irradiation and decay timescales are set so that the buildup and decay can be
# observed
